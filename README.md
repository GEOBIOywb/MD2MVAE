# MD2MVAE
Dear readers, this is the codes for our new work MD2MVAE. 
Since the manuscript has not been published, the whole codes and datasets would be uploaded latter.
Now, we only provide part of them and the rest would be supplemented in the following days.
The datasets could be downloaded at: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4587297.

Moreover, we recommend the Github repository of our previous work "Convolutional Two-Stream Generative Adversarial Network-Based Hyperspectral Feature Extraction" as: https://github.com/Geoscienceywb/sc2GAN-FE.git.
If you think it is useful, please cite it as:
W. Yu, M. Zhang, Z. He and Y. Shen, "Convolutional Two-Stream Generative Adversarial Network-Based Hyperspectral Feature Extraction," in IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, vol. 60, pp. 1-10, 2022, Art no. 5506010, doi: 10.1109/TGRS.2021.3073924.

Thanks and good luck!
